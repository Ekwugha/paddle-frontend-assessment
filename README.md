# Getting Started with Create React App

## Dependencies

In this project, the following dependencies are used:

### `react-bootstrap`

This dependency is a css framework that is use for easy styling and responsiveness of the app.

### `fontawesome-icon`

This dependency is for adding ons to a website.

#### `How to run the app`

After cloning or downloading the source code, you cd into the project and you run yarn add or npm install just to install all possible dependencies that runs the app. Then `run code .` and `yarn start` to view in your favourite editor and to see the site also in the live server.

##### `Add Ons`
This is a really cool site with good features but if it were to be real project i woukd suggest to have a contact section that consists of phone number and emails, social media links and even a blog to share more about tech from the company and around the globle. Plus having proper SEO plans too.
